Hello! My name is Nada. I'm a class of 2023 student at UCSD majoring in computer science and minoring in design and business. I'm currently also a computer science tutor in the computer science department, a middle school mentor with an organization called [CovEd](coved.org"CovEd"), and a publicity, social media, and monthly newsletter intern at the [Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion community](https://cse.ucsd.edu/diversity_equity_inclusion) in the UCSD computer science department.
